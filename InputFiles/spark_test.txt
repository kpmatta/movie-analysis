Spark Test
===========
Use the MovieLens 1 Million Dataset for this exercise. It can be downloaded from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens.
Dataset is available under http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip. 
Please refer to the Read Me file at http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m-README.txt for details about the data.

Use Spark and (Scala or Java) to complete the following test.

1. Define the project folder structure and dependencies using either SBT or Maven or gradle. Add Apache Spark dependency to the project.
2. Write Spark code to generate the following outputs in the target directory inside the project.
A. A CSV file containing list of unique Genres and no of movies under each genres
